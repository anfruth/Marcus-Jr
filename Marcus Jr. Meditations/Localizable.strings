"00What_is" = "What is under your control and what is not";
"00What_is_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 1";
"00What_is_quotation" = "Seek at once, therefore, to be able to say to every unpleasing semblance, 'You are but a semblance and by no means the real thing.' And then examine it by those rules which you have; and first and chiefly by this: whether it concerns the things which are within our own power or those which are not; and if it concerns anything beyond our power, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.";
"00What_is_commentary" = "Externals, as the Stoics would say, or things that lie beyond our control, should warrant indifference. If we focus on externals and we don't get what we want, we are bound to be disappointed and sad. Instead, the Stoics encourage you, as a rational being, to pursue wisdom, large parts of which are found in this app.";
"00What_is_action" = "Consider the things that have been frustrating you. Are they within your control? If not, what aspects of the situation are in your control? Could you react to your problems in a better way?";

"01Be_unattached_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 2";
"01Be_unattached_quotation" = "If, then, you shun only those undesirable things which you can control, you will never incur anything which you shun; but if you shun sickness, or death, or poverty, you will run the risk of wretchedness. Remove [the habit of] aversion, then, from all things that are not within our power, and apply it to things undesirable which are within our power.";
"01Be_unattached_commentary" = "Be indifferent to negative things happening in your life that you do not control. By not attaching high stakes to a particular outcome, you risk the possibility of getting something you don't want. Focus instead on how you react to negative situations because that is in your control.";
"01Be_unattached_action" = "Can you think of anything that you're strongly attached to that is not in your control? If so, practice indifference, and focus on your reaction to the situation, not the situation itself.";

"02Desire_things" = "Desire things to be as they already are";
"02Desire_things_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 8";
"02Desire_things_quotation" = "Demand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.";
"02Desire_things_commentary" = "In other words, change the way you react to the event. If you are successful in desiring things as they are, you won't only be indifferent to the outcome, but also pleased by it.";
"02Desire_things_action" = "Practice full acceptance of reality.";

"03Nothing_is" = "Nothing is an impediment to you"; // chapter 9
"03Nothing_is_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 9";
"03Nothing_is_quotation" = "Sickness is an impediment to the body, but not to the will unless itself pleases...and say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens. For you will find it to be an impediment to something else, but not truly to yourself.";
"03Nothing_is_commentary" = "Sickness and other bad things outside your control do not have to hamper your will. You are fully in control of your will and how you choose to react to any situation.";

"04Remind_yourself_quotation" = "With regard to whatever objects either delight the mind or contribute to use or are tenderly beloved, remind yourself of what nature they are, beginning with the merest trifles: if you have a favorite cup, that it is but a cup of which you are fond of—for thus, if it is broken, you can bear it; if you embrace your child or your wife, that you embrace a mortal—and thus, if either of them dies, you can bear it.";
"04Remind_yourself_commentary" = "Remember the bad things happen and that some of those bad things, like death, are inevitable. By facing this reality, you'll learn to appreciate the things you have.";
"04Remind_yourself_action" = "Gently, not in an anxious manner, remind yourself of the negative realities of life. Know that things will go wrong, and you won't be so distraught when they do. You can handle them because you have chosen not to be affected by things you cannot control.";


"05Our_view" = "Our view of things, not things themselves, disturb us"; // chapter 5
"05Our_view_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 5";
"05Our_view_quotation" = "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things...When, therefore, we are hindered or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves - that is, to our own views.";
// no commentary, self-explanatory.
"05Our_view_action" = "Reflect on what bothers you. Understand it is your attitude towards that thing that bothers you.";

"06Do_not_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 6";
"06Do_not_quotation" = "Be not elated at any excellence not your own...What then is your own? The use of phenomena of existence. So that when you are in harmony with nature in this respect, you will be elated with some reason; for you will be elated at some good of your own.";
"06Do_not_commentary" = "You may own something that you're proud to have, but do not be prideful over it. Instead, focus on \"living in harmony with nature\" or, in other words, acting rationally, pursuing wisdom, and being a good person.";

"07Be_ready_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 7";
"07Be_ready_quotation" = "...thus likewise in life, if, instead of a truffle or shellfish, such a thing as a wife or child be granted you, there is no objection; but if the captain calls, run to the ship, leave all these things, and never look behind.";
"07Be_ready_commentary" = "You may have a spouse or a child, but eventually you will die. Don't go fighting and screaming into death, but do so with acceptance.";

"08Seek the_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 10";
"08Seek the_quotation" = "Upon every accident, remember to turn toward yourself and inquire what faculty you have for its use. If you encounter a handsome person, you will find continence the faculty needed; if pain, then fortitude; if reviling, then patience.";
"08Seek the_commentary" = "You have a trait within you that can deal with any temptation. Do your best to employ those traits when called for.";

"09You_cannot_commentary" = "Do not see the people or things in your life as belonging to you. Everything exists only temporarily. Going back to non-existence is the natural state of all things. Understanding this truth will help soften the blow when the loss happens.";

"10The_price" = "The price of anxiety is too high to pay"; //chapter 12
"10The_price_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 12";
"10The_price_quotation" = "If you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as these: 'If I neglect my affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will be good for nothing.' For it were better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better that your servant should be bad than you unhappy.";
"10The_price_commentary" = "Fear and worrying is worse than the negative imagined outcome happening. It is better to let that thing happen than to give up your tranquility.";
"10The_price_action" = "Consider the torment you've put yourself through due to excessive worry. To stop worrying, accept that the bad thing could happen, but it is better that it does than for you to suffer worrying.";

"11Be_indifferent_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 13";
"11Be_indifferent_quotation" = "If you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with regard to externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and though you should appear to others to be somebody, distrust yourself. ";
"11Be_indifferent_commentary" = "Don't let judgements from others bother you over things you cannot control (externals.) Wealth, status, intelligence, and any other external should not concern you because you live in accordance with nature. By living in accordance with nature, you accept things as they are that you cannot control and focus on those things that you can.";

"12Do_not" = "Do not let other people control your happiness"; // 14
"12Do_not_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 14";
"12Do_not_quotation" = "If you wish your children and your wife and your friends to live forever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which are not so, and what belongs to others to be your own...Exercise, therefore, what is in your power. A man’s master is he who is able to confer or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.";
"12Do_not_commentary" = "Do not allow yourself to have a master. Be indifferent to your former master's rewards and punishments.";

"13Be_indifferent_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 15";
"13Be_indifferent_quotation" = "Remember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire toward it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods.";
"13Be_indifferent_commentary" = "Don't be overly aggressive in trying to get things that lie outside your control. Accept the preferred indifferents as they come, in moderation. Or, if you really want to challenge yourself, do not take any food even though it is \"brought round to you\".";
"13Be_indifferent_action" = "Are you pursuing anything outside your control aggressively? Refocus on aspects that you do control and accept the good things of life in moderation.";

"14Be_kind" = "Be kind to those who are suffering but don't let it spread to you"; // chap 16
"14Be_kind_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 16";
"14Be_kind_quotation" = "When you see anyone weeping for grief, either that his son has gone abroad or that he has suffered in his affairs, take care not to be overcome by the apparent evil, but discriminate and be ready to say, 'What hurts this man is not this occurrence itself—for another man might not be hurt by it—but the view he chooses to take of it.' As far as conversation goes, however, do not disdain to accommodate yourself to him and, if need be, to groan with him.";
"14Be_kind_commentary" = "Remind yourself that people ultimately suffer from the way they view things than by the things that actually happen to them. Still be good to people who are suffering though.";
"14Be_kind_action" = "Think about something painful in your life. Could you imagine a way of looking at that thing that makes it less painful or not painful at all?";


"15Act_the" = "Act the best you can given your position in life"; // 17
"15Act_the_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 17";
"15Act_the_quotation" = "If it be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man, or a cripple, or a ruler, or a private citizen, see that you act it well. For this is your business—to act well the given part, but to choose it belongs to another.";

"16Every_circumstance_quotation" = "...but discriminate and say, 'Nothing is portended to me, either to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But to me all portents are lucky if I will. For whatsoever happens, it belongs to me to derive advantage therefrom.'";
"16Every_circumstance_commentary" = "If you choose to react to a negative event in some positive way, then the negative event doesn't have to be negative at all. The way you view things determines what is good and bad, not the things themselves.";
"16Every_circumstance_action" = "Think of some negative events that have happened recently. Can you find any positive in them?";

"17Seek_freedom" = "Seek freedom, not status"; // 19
"17Seek_freedom_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 19";
"17Seek_freedom_quotation" = "You can be unconquerable if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own power to conquer...But, for your part, do not desire to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is a disregard of things which lie not within our own power.";
"17Seek_freedom_commentary" = "Don't worry about getting something that is outside your control. Focus on what is under your control and you will be free and undefeatable.";
"17Seek_freedom_action" = "Think about some things that you want that are outside your control. Now imagine how free you'd be if you gave that up and only pursued things under your control.";

"18You_decide" = "You decide when you are provoked"; // 20
"18You_decide_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 20";
"18You_decide_quotation" = "Remember that it is not he who gives abuse or blows, who affronts, but the view we take of these things as insulting. When, therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you.";
"18You_decide_action" = "Think of times you've gotten angry, and then imagine how you could change your opinion about the situation so that you're not angry.";

"19Death_makes" = "Death makes life impermanent";
"19Death_makes_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 21";
"19Death_makes_quotation" = "Let death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible, be daily before your eyes, but death chiefly; and you will never entertain an abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.";

"20Be_prepared" = "Be prepared to be ridiculed for your principles";
"20Be_prepared_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 22";
"20Be_prepared_quotation" = "If you have an earnest desire toward philosophy, prepare yourself from the very first to have the multitude laugh and sneer, and say...For remember that, if you are persistent, those very persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, you will incur a double ridicule.";

"21Externals_should_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 23";
"21Externals_should_quotation" = "If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of life. Be content, then, in everything, with being a philosopher...";
"21Externals_should_commentary" = "Don't fixate on externals, or things outside your control, or else you will suffer.";
"21Externals_should_action" = "Think of any externals you're fixating on. Focus instead on the philosophic life.";

"22Do_not" = "Do not sacrifice integrity for status";
"22Do_not_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 24";
"22Do_not_quotation" = "Let not such considerations as these distress you: 'I shall live in discredit and be nobody anywhere.' For if discredit be an evil, you can no more be involved in evil through another than in baseness. Is it any business of yours, then, to get power or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How then, after all, is this discredit? And how it is true that you will be nobody anywhere when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are within your own power, in which you may be of the greatest consequence?";
"22Do_not_commentary" = "Do not worry about status or power. These are things outside your control. The things that matter (virtue) are within your control and have the greatest consequence on your life.";
"22Do_not_action" = "If you find yourself worrying about your status in life, remember that the only thing you need is virtue. It makes no sense to worry about things like status because you cannot control them.";

"23The_price" = "The price of some externals may not be worth it";
"23The_price_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 25";
"23The_price_quotation" = "Is anyone preferred before you at an entertainment, or in courtesies, or in confidential intercourse? If these things are good, you ought to rejoice that he has them; and if they are evil, do not be grieved that you have them not. And remember that you cannot be permitted to rival others in externals without using the same means to obtain them.";
"23The_price_action" = "Don't be upset if others have things you want. Remember that they often sacrificed their integrity to get these things. For you, a person of wisdom, the price is not worth it.";

"24React_the" = "React the same way we would tell others to under trying circumstances";
"24React_the_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 26";
"24React_the_quotation" = "Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would not say, 'This is an accident of mortality.' But if anyone’s own child happens to die, it is immediately, 'Alas! how wretched am I!' It should be always remembered how we are affected on hearing the same thing concerning others.";
"24React_the_action" = "Think of tough things you are going through or have gone through. Do what you would tell another to do in the same situation";

"25The_evil" = "The evil we endure is our own doing";
"25The_evil_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 27";
"25The_evil_quotation" = "As a mark is not set up for the sake of missing the aim, so neither does the nature of evil exist in the world.";
"25The_evil_commentary" = "From footnotes: \"Happiness, the effect of virtue, is the mark which God has set up for us to aim at. Our missing it is no work of His; nor so properly anything real, as a mere negative and failure of our own.\" In other words, the suffering we endure is from our failure to be virtuous.";
"25The_evil_action" = "Can you think of any time where you acted unwisely, excessively, unjustly, or cowardly? How much better would the incident have been if you acted virtuously?";

"26Don't_let" = "Don't let others negatively influence your mind";
"26Don't_let_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 28";
"26Don't_let_quotation" = "If a person had delivered up your body to some passer-by, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in delivering up your own mind to any reviler, to be disconcerted and confounded?";
"26Don't_let_commentary" = "Just as you would be angry if you gave someone else control over your body, you should be just as angry if someone else controlled your thoughts in a negative way. You control your own mind. Don't let others negatively influence you.";

"27Understand_the" = "Understand the price of reason and pay it";
"27Understand_the_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 29";
"27Understand_the_quotation" = "In every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit, indeed, careless of the consequences, and when these are developed, you will shamefully desist. 'I would conquer at the Olympic Games.' But consider what precedes and what follows, and then, if it be for your advantage, engage in the affair. You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated hour, in heat and cold; you must drink no cold water, and sometimes no wine—in a word, you must give yourself up to your trainer as to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, swallow an abundance of dust, receive stripes [for negligence], and, after all, lose the victory. When you have reckoned up all this, if your inclination still holds, set about the combat...You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob.";
"27Understand_the_commentary" = "Do not take half measures. If you want to succeed at any activity, including improving your character or pursuing wisdom, you must throw yourself into the commitment whole heartedly.";
"27Understand_the_action" = "What commitment have you made towards pursuing wisdom and virtue? If you are dabbling in these concepts, consider becoming serious and exercise the appropriate amount of discipline to achieve your goal.";

"28Be_good" = "Be good to others even if they treat you poorly";
"28Be_good_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 30";
"28Be_good_quotation" = "Duties are universally measured by relations. Is a certain man your father? In this are implied taking care of him, submitting to him in all things, patiently receiving his reproaches, his correction. But he is a bad father. Is your natural tie, then, to a good father? No, but to a father. Is a brother unjust? Well, preserve your own just relation toward him. Consider not what he does, but what you are to do to keep your own will in a state conformable to nature, for another cannot hurt you unless you please.";
"28Be_good_commentary" = "Do your duty in your relationships. Even if you are treated poorly, living according to nature, or according to reason, requires that you be good.";

"29Good_and_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 31";
"29Good_and_quotation" = "And it is not possible for this to be affected in any other way than by withdrawing yourself from things which are not within our own power, and by making good or evil to consist only in those which are. For if you suppose any other things to be either good or evil, it is inevitable that, when you are disappointed of what you wish or incur what you would avoid, you should reproach and blame their authors. For every creature is naturally formed to flee and abhor things that appear hurtful and that which causes them; and to pursue and admire those which appear beneficial and that which causes them. It is impracticable, then, that one who supposes himself to be hurt should rejoice in the person who, as he thinks, hurts him, just as it is impossible to rejoice in the hurt itself.";
"29Good_and_commentary" = "The ancient Stoics believed that the world was laid out according to a divine order. In order for the gods to be perfect and good, Epictetus is saying good and evil only exist in what we control. The gods, then, could not be blamed for negative external events because those events are outside our control so they are indifferent to us. Good and evil, then, consists only in how we control ourselves. Evil is our own doing. Whether you believe in a divine order or not, the important message is that the positive and negative in our lives can be mitigated by how we react to externals.";
"29Good_and_action" = "Have you become discouraged by the negative in this world? Consider the actions you could take within your control that could mitigate those negative forces. The rest is indifferent to you.";

"30Be_indifferent_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 32";
"30Be_indifferent_quotation" = "When you have recourse to divination, remember that you know not what the event will be, and you come to learn it of the diviner; but of what nature it is you knew before coming; at least, if you are of philosophic mind. For if it is among the things not within our own power, it can by no means be either good or evil. Do not, therefore, bring with you to the diviner either desire or aversion—else you will approach him trembling—but first clearly understand that every event is indifferent and nothing to you, of whatever sort it may be; for it will be in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder.";
"30Be_indifferent_commentary" = "The future should not matter to you because external events do not matter to you. Only what you control is of importance.";

"31Think_clearly_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 34";
"31Think_clearly_quotation" = "If you are dazzled by the semblance of any promised pleasure, guard yourself against being bewildered by it; but let the affair wait your leisure, and procure yourself some delay. Then bring to your mind both points of time—that in which you shall enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself, after you have enjoyed it—and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will rejoice and applaud yourself if you abstain.";
"31Think_clearly_action" = "If you are tempted to do something you know you shouldn't, delay doing so for a little while. During that delay, remind yourself of the disappointment you will have in yourself after you've given in.";

"32Do_good_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 35";
"32Do_good_quotation" = "When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shrink from being seen to do it, even though the world should misunderstand it; for if you are not acting rightly, shun the action itself; if you are, why fear those who wrongly censure you?";
"32Do_good_action" = "Think about something you might do that is good but unpopular. Remind yourself the people's opinions are externals and you aren't affected by them unless you allow yourself to be.";


"33Appreciate_others" = "Appreciate others who do good things for you"; // 36
"33Appreciate_others_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 36";
"33Appreciate_others_quotation" = "As the proposition, 'either it is day or it is night,' has much force in a disjunctive argument, but none at all in a conjunctive one, so, at a feast, to choose the largest share is very suitable to the bodily appetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit of the entertainment. Remember, then, when you eat with another, not only the value to the body of those things which are set before you, but also the value of proper courtesy toward your host.";
"33Appreciate_others_action" = "Do you have those in your life that are providing good things for you? If so, make sure you take care to appreciate them instead of merely the benefit for yourself.";

"34Know_your_action" = "Are you trying to do too much? If so, figure out a reasonable plan so you can give the proper attention to what you can do instead of doing everything in a mediocre way.";


"35Guard_against" = "Guard against influences that would compromise your integrity"; // 38
"35Guard_against_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 38";
"35Guard_against_quotation" = "As in walking you take care not to tread upon a nail, or turn your foot, so likewise take care not to hurt the ruling faculty of your mind. And if we were to guard against this in every action, we should enter upon action more safely.";
"35Guard_against_commentary" = "Make sure to protect your mind as you do your body. A sound mind has integrity, treats others well, and lives rationally.";

"1Marcus" = "\"Men seek retirement in the country, on the sea-coast, in the mountains; and you too have frequent longings for such distractions. Yet surely this is great folly, since you may retire into yourself at any hour you please. Nowhere can a man find any retreat more quiet and more full of leisure than in his own soul; especially when there is that within it on which, if he but look, he is straightway quite at rest.\"";
"2Marcus" = "\"Whenever your situation forces trouble upon you, return quickly to yourself, and interrupt the rhythm of life no longer than you are compelled. Your grasp of the harmony will grow surer by continual recurrence to it.\"";
"3Marcus" = "\"When you are grieved about anything external it is not the thing itself which afflicts you, but your judgment about it. This judgment it is in your power to efface.\"";
"4Marcus" = "\"Now death and life, glory and reproach, pain and pleasure, riches and poverty—all these happen equally to the good and to the bad. But, as they are neither honourable nor shameful, they are therefore neither good nor evil.\"";
"5Marcus" = "\"Time is a river, a violent torrent of things coming into being. Each one, as soon as it has appeared, is swept away: it is succeeded by another which is swept away in its turn.\"";
"6Marcus" = "\"The character of your most frequent impressions will be the character of your mind.\"";
"7Marcus" = "\"The one precious thing in life is to spend it in a steady course of truth and justice, with kindliness even for the false and the unjust.\"";

"9Marcus" = "\"If you discharge your present duty with firm and zealous, yet kindly, observance of the laws of reason; if you regard no by-gains, but keep pure within you your immortal part, as if obliged to restore it at once to him who gave it; if you hold to this with no further desires or aversions, and be content with the natural discharge of your present task, and with the heroic sincerity of all you say or utter, you will live well. And herein no man can hinder you.\"";
"10Marcus" = "\"Concerning pain: Pain which cannot be borne brings us deliverance. Pain that lasts musts needs be bearable. The mind can abstract itself from the body, and the soul takes no hurt. As to the parts which suffer by pain, let them, if they can, make their own protest.\"";
"11Marcus" = "\"Look attentively on each particular thing you do, and ask yourself if death be a terror because it deprives you of this.\"";
"12Marcus" = "\"Perceive at last that there is within you something better and more divine than the immediate cause of your sensations of pleasure and pain; something, in short, beyond the strings which move the puppet.\"";
