// number in key to make sure no duplicates, not using only number in case I or someone else accidentally inserted a meditation into the middle of the list and incremented meditations after. The key for user defaults then would change and cause issues. Key for user defaults must stay the same no matter what.

// never change numbers in keys even if put new key in middle of list and keys are out of order by number. That is ok.

"00What_is" = "What is under your control and what is not";
"00What_is_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 1";
"00What_is_quotation" = "Seek at once, therefore, to be able to say to every unpleasing semblance, “You are but a semblance and by no means the real thing.” And then examine it by those rules which you have; and first and chiefly by this: whether it concerns the things which are within our own power or those which are not; and if it concerns anything beyond our power, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.";
"00What_is_commentary" = "Externals, as the Stoics would say, or things that lie beyond our control, should warrant indifference. If we focus on externals and we don't get what we want, we are bound to be dissapointed and sad. Instead, the Stoics encourage you, as a rational being, to pursue wisdom, large parts of which are found in this app.;
"00What_is_action" = "Consider the things that have been frustrating you. Are they within your control? If not, what aspects of the situation are in your control? Could you react to your problems in a better way?;

"01Be_unattached" = "Be unattached to things you do not control";
"01Be_unattached_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 2";
"01Be_unattached_quotation" = "If, then, you shun only those undesirable things which you can control, you will never incur anything which you shun; but if you shun sickness, or death, or poverty, you will run the risk of wretchedness. Remove [the habit of] aversion, then, from all things that are not within our power, and apply it to things undesirable which are within our power.";
"01Be_unattached_commentary" = "Be indifferent to negative things happening in yor life that you do not control. By not attaching high stakes to a particular outcome, you risk the possbility of getting something you don't want. Focus instead on how you react to negative situations because that is in your control.";
"01Be_unattached_action" = "Can you think of anything that you're strongly attached to that is not in your control? If so, practice indifference, and focus on your reaction to the situation, not the situation itself.";

"02Desire_things" = "Desire things to be as they already are";
"02Desire_things_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 8";
"02Desire_things_quotation" = "Demand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.";
"02Desire_things_commentary" = "In other words, change the way you react to the event. If you are successful in desiring things as they are, you won't only be indifferent to the outcome, but also pleased by it.";
"02Desire_things_action" = "Practice full acceptance of reality."

"03Nothing_is" = "Nothing is an impediment to you"; // chapter 9
"03Nothing_is_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 9";
"03Nothing_is_quotation" = "Sickness is an impediment to the body, but not to the will unless itself pleases...and say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens. For you will find it to be an impediment to something else, but not truly to yourself";
"03Nothing_is_commentary" = "Sickness and other bad things outside your control do not have to hamper your will. You are fully in control of your will and how you choose to react to any situation.";
"03Nothing_is_action" = "Have you felt defeated or unmotivated recently? If so, choose to keep your spirits up. You do not have to allow anything to impede your will.";

"04Remind_yourself" = "Remind yourself that bad things happen."; //chapter 4
"04Remind_yourself_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 4";
"04Remind_yourself_quotation" = "With regard to whatever objects either delight the mind or contribute to use or are tenderly beloved, remind yourself of what nature they are, beginning with the merest trifles: if you have a favorite cup, that it is but a cup of which you are fond of—for thus, if it is broken, you can bear it; if you embrace your child or your wife, that you embrace a mortal—and thus, if either of them dies, you can bear it.";
"04Remind_yourself_commentary" = "Remember the bad things happen and that some of those bad things, like death, are inevitable. By facing this reality, you'll learn to appreciate the things you have.";
"04Remind_yourself_action" = "Gently, not in an anxious manner, remind yourself of the negative realities of life. Know that things will go wrong, and you won't be so distraught when they do. You can handle them because you have chosen not to be affected by things you cannot control.";


"05Our_view" = "Our view of things, not things themselves, disturb us"; // chapter 5
"05Our_view_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 5";
"05Our_view_quotation" = "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things...When, therefore, we are hindered or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves - that is, to our own views.";
// no commentary, self-explanatory.
"05Our_view_action" = "Reflect on what bothers you. Understand it is your attitude towards that thing that bothers you.";

"06Do_not" = "Do not attach your happiness to the things you own"; // chapter 6 correct
"06Do_not_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 6";
"06Do_not_quotation" = "Be not elated at any excellence not your own...What then is your own? The use of phenomena of existence. So that when you are in harmony with nature in this respect, you will be elated with some reason; for you will be elated at some good of your own.";
"06Do_not_commentary" = "You may own something that you're proud to have, but do not be prideful over it. Instead, focus on \"living in harmony with nature\" or, in other words, acting rationally, pursuing wisdom, and being a good person.";
"06Do_not_action" = "Find something you own that you're proud of. Try your best to stop being proud and focus on being a wise and good person instead.";

"07Be_ready" = "Remind yourself of your mortality"; // ch 7
"07Be_ready_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 7";
"07Be_ready_quotation" = "...thus likewise in life, if, instead of a truffle or shellfish, such a thing as a wife or child be granted you, there is no objection; but if the captain calls, run to the ship, leave all these things, and never look behind.";
"07Be_ready_commentary" = "You may have a spouse or a child, but eventually you will die. Don't go fighting and screaming into death, but do so with acceptance.";
"07Be_ready_action" = "Meditate on how you can become more comfortable with the idea of your own death. Try to be at peace with it.";

"08Seek the" = "Seek the strength and wisdom within yourself"; //chapter 10
"08Seek the_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 10";
"08Seek the_quotation" = "Upon every accident, remember to turn toward yourself and inquire what faculty you have for its use. If you encounter a handsome person, you will find continence the faculty needed; if pain, then fortitude; if reviling, then patience.";
"08Seek the_commentary" = "You have a trait within you that can deal with any temptation. Do your best to employ those traits when called for.";
"08Seek the_action" = "What bad habits do you have? What positive trait do you have within you to combat it?";

"09You_cannot_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 11";
"09You_cannot_quotation" = "Never say of anything, “I have lost it,” but, “I have restored it.” Has your child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored. Has your estate been taken away? That likewise is restored.";
"09You_cannot_commentary" = "Do not see the people or things in your life as belonging to you. Everything exists only temporarily. Going back to non-existence is the natural state of all things. Understanding this truth will help soften the blow when the loss happens.";
"09You_cannot_action" = "Consider the people and things you are attached to. Reflect on their impermanence.";

"10The_price" = "The price of anxiety is too high to pay"; //chapter 12
"10The_price_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 12";
"10The_price_quotation" = "If you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as these: “If I neglect my affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will be good for nothing.” For it were better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better that your servant should be bad than you unhappy.";
"10The_price_commentary" = "Fear and worrying is worse than the negative imagined outcome happening. It is better to let that thing happen than to give up your tranquility.";
"10The_price_action" = "Consider the torment you've put yourself through due to excessive worry. To stop worrying, accept that the bad thing could happen, but it is better that it does than for you to suffer worrying."

"11Be_indifferent" = "Be indifferent to others judging you"; // 13
"11Be_indifferent_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 13";
"11Be_indifferent_quotation" = "If you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with regard to externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and though you should appear to others to be somebody, distrust yourself. ";
"11Be_indifferent_commentary" = "Don't let judgements from others bother you over things you cannot control (externals.) Wealth, status, intelligence, and any other external should not concern you because you live in accordance with nature. By living in accordance with nature, you accept things as they are that you cannot control and focus on those things that you can.";
"11Be_indifferent_action" = "Think about some of the things people judge you over of which you have no control. Ignore them and think of ways you can improve things you do control.";

"12Do_not" = "Do not let other people control your happiness"; // 14
"12Do_not_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 14";
"12Do_not_quotation" = "If you wish your children and your wife and your friends to live forever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which are not so, and what belongs to others to be your own...Exercise, therefore, what is in your power. A man’s master is he who is able to confer or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.";
"12Do_not_commentary" = "Do not allow yourself to have a master. Be indifferent to your former master's rewards and punishments.";

"13Be_indifferent_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 15";
"13Be_indifferent_quotation" = "Remember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire toward it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods.";
"13Be_indifferent_commentary" = "Don't be overly aggressive in trying to get things that lie outside your control. Accept the preferred indifferents as they come, in moderation. Or, if you really want to challenge yourself, do not take any food even though it is \"brought round to you\"";
"13Be_indifferent_action" = "Are you pursuing anything outside your control aggressively? Refocus on aspects that you do control and accept the good things of life in moderation.";

"14Be_kind" = "Be kind to those who are suffering but don't let it spread to you"; // chap 16
"14Be_kind_title" = "Enchiridion Chapter 16";
"14Be_kind_quotation" = "When you see anyone weeping for grief, either that his son has gone abroad or that he has suffered in his affairs, take care not to be overcome by the apparent evil, but discriminate and be ready to say, “What hurts this man is not this occurrence itself—for another man might not be hurt by it—but the view he chooses to take of it.” As far as conversation goes, however, do not disdain to accommodate yourself to him and, if need be, to groan with him.";
"14Be_kind_commentary" = "Remind yourself that people ultimately suffer from the way they view things than by the things that actually happen to them. Still be good to people who are suffering though.";
