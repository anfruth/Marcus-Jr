// number in key to make sure no duplicates, not using only number in case I or someone else accidentally inserted a meditation into the middle of the list and incremented meditations after. The key for user defaults then would change and cause issues. Key for user defaults must stay the same no matter what.

// never change numbers in keys even if put new key in middle of list and keys are out of order by number. That is ok.
